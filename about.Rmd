## About Me
Hello! My name is Mann Talati and I am a current junior at Metea Valley High School. Some of my hobbies include playing volleyball, gaming, lifting weights, hanging with friends, and coding.

## About This Project
One of my favorite hobbies includes playing volleyball which inspired me to take on this project. I love learning more about the sport of volleyball and learning statistics about them. Watching NCAA Women's Volleyball is amazing and learning extra facts about the sport. Coding with R is great because of the opportunities available with data science and expanding horizons.
